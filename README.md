# MEDINSIGHT-AI-Medical-Image-Analyzer
Developed an AI-powered web app for automatic Chest X-ray disease detection and Brain MRI tumor classification using deep learning (TensorFlow/PyTorch). Features include real-time analysis, PDF report generation, and secure patient data storage with an intuitive Flask and Bootstrap-based UI.
 AI-Powered Medical Image Analyzer
Welcome to my AI-based Medical Image Analyzer project! This web application allows doctors, researchers, and healthcare enthusiasts to effortlessly analyze Chest X-rays for diseases like Pneumonia, Cardiomegaly, Edema, etc., and Brain MRI scans for tumor detection — all within a friendly, easy-to-use web interface.

What this project does
Chest X-Ray Analysis: Detects multiple diseases including Pneumonia, Cardiomegaly, and more.
Brain MRI Tumor Detection: Classifies tumors such as Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary Tumor, or No Tumor.
PDF Report Generation: Generates detailed, downloadable reports for each patient.
Patient Record Management: View, store, and manage past patient records seamlessly.

Technologies Used
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap5, Jinja2
Backend: Flask (Python)
AI Models: TensorFlow, PyTorch, TorchVision (for custom CNN models)
Utilities: SQLite for database, FPDF for PDF report creation, OpenCV & PIL for image handling
Others: Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy for data processing and plotting

Features
Fully functional UI for both X-ray and MRI analysis
Live AI predictions with graphical output
Export and download patient reports in PDF format
Stores patient data in CSV/Excel format
Responsive, modern design built with Bootstrap

Future Improvements
Integration with cloud storage for record handling
Real-time multi-disease prediction dashboard
Model improvement for even higher accuracy and faster inference

Why this project?
To assist doctors and radiologists with quick, reliable, and accessible AI-based diagnosis tools — especially useful in remote areas or resource-limited settings.
